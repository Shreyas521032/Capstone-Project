## 🚀 Problem Statement
In the rapidly evolving digital healthcare landscape, there is a pressing need to harness data-driven insights to enhance patient care, optimize platform usability, and improve overall healthcare outcomes. This project aims to build an **AI-powered Healthcare Data Analytics Platform** that analyzes patient interaction data to refine user experience, accessibility, and engagement. By leveraging machine learning models and advanced data visualization, this platform provides a **benchmark dataset** for future healthcare developers to design more user-centric solutions.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset has been provided by the **Cancer Awareness and Rehabilitation Foundation NGO (CARF)**. It includes survey data collected from **over 200 cancer patients and their families** to analyze their experiences with healthcare websites. This dataset was obtained from the **initial and final phases** of a website development project (**carfngo.org**), aimed at awareness and rehabilitation.

This data serves as a valuable reference for healthcare organizations looking to **enhance digital patient engagement and optimize online platforms for better healthcare delivery.** 🏥📈

## 💡 Solution Approach
We employed a **multi-faceted approach** integrating **machine learning, statistical analysis, and business intelligence** tools to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. Here's how we did it:

🔹 **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** - Handled missing values, normalized numerical data, and categorized qualitative responses.

🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊** - Identified key trends in user behavior, accessibility, and engagement levels.

🔹 **Machine Learning Models 🤖** - Implemented:
   - **Linear Regression** for **user experience, navigation efficiency, and feature importance predictions**.
   - **Logistic Regression** to analyze **event participation, multilingual preferences, and symptom checker usage**.
   - **Multiple Regression** to examine the combined impact of multiple factors on **user satisfaction, engagement, and navigation patterns**.

🔹 **Interactive Visualizations 🖥️** - Used **Power BI & Streamlit** to present real-time dashboards for stakeholders.

🔹 **Cloud Deployment ☁️** - Hosted the analytics platform on **Streamlit** for easy access and scalability.
