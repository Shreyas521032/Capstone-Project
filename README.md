## 🚀 Problem Statement
In modern healthcare, **data-driven decision-making** is essential for improving patient outcomes, enhancing user engagement, and optimizing healthcare resources. Despite the growing adoption of digital health platforms, many organizations struggle to analyze **user behavior**, **feature adoption**, and **platform usability** effectively. This project bridges that gap by building a **Healthcare Data Analytics Platform** that not only **visualizes engagement trends** but also leverages **predictive modeling** to identify factors influencing user satisfaction, accessibility, and health-related interactions. The insights derived can serve as a benchmark for developing better healthcare technology solutions that cater to patient and caregiver needs.

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage


🔗 **Deployed Project:** [Live Streamlit App](https://shreyas-capstone-project-deploy-rs.streamlit.app/)

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset has been provided by the **Cancer Awareness and Rehabilitation Foundation NGO (CARF)**. It includes survey data collected from **over 200 cancer patients and their families** to analyze their experiences with healthcare websites. This dataset was obtained from the **initial and final phases** of our website development project [carfngo.org](https://www.carfngo.org/) aimed at awareness and rehabilitation.

This data serves as a valuable reference for healthcare organizations looking to **enhance digital patient engagement and optimize online platforms for better healthcare delivery.** 🏥📈

## 💡 Solution Approach
We employed a **multi-faceted approach** integrating **machine learning, statistical analysis, and business intelligence** tools to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. Here's how we did it:

🔹 **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning 📡** - Handled missing values, normalized numerical data, and categorized qualitative responses.

🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊** - Identified key trends in user behavior, accessibility, and engagement levels.

🔹 **Machine Learning Models 🤖** - Implemented:
   - **Linear Regression** for **user experience, navigation efficiency, and feature importance predictions**.
   - **Logistic Regression** to analyze **event participation, multilingual preferences, and symptom checker usage**.
   - **Multiple Regression** to examine the combined impact of multiple factors on **user satisfaction, engagement, and navigation patterns**.

🔹 **Interactive Visualizations 🖥️** - Used **Power BI & Streamlit** to present real-time dashboards for stakeholders.

🔹 **Cloud Deployment ☁️** - Hosted the analytics platform on **Streamlit** for easy access and scalability.
